> **what_to_do** is a simple task manager for web.

## :art: Features

You're able to:

- Create new tasks, defining name and date;
- Update tasks's names;
- Mark a task as important;
- Mark a task as finished;
- Delete tasks;

## :rocket: How to run

To run the application in development it's necessary to have Yarn installed. Then, with the repository downloaded, run `yarn` to install the dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, it's possible to run the application by executing `yarn dev`.

However **what_to_do** is available online, thanks to Vercel, and can be found at https://what-to-do-khaki.vercel.app/.
